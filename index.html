                  In the dark alleys of Runeterra, the demonic creature Evelynn seeks her next victim.
                  She attracts prey with her voluptuous human-female appearance,
                  but once the victim succumbs to her charm, Evelynn's true form is revealed.
                  The creature then subjects its victims to unspeakable torment, gratifying itself with the pain of others.
                  For her, these contacts are innocent affairs;
                  For the rest of Runeterra, it's macabre tales of lewd encounters gone wrong and terrifying reminders
                  about the cost of unbridled desire.
